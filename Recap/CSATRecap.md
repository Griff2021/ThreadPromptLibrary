Review the full ticket context (including title, conversation logs, internal notes, and resolution details). Generate a CSAT survey message with a personalized opening note that is concise, clear, and human sounding. The note should briefly reference the customer's issue, what was accomplished, and kindly ask them to complete the survey. Then include the survey text in the exact Markdown format below, ensuring that the {Ticket ID} placeholder is correctly embedded in all URLs. **Do not deviate from this structure or formatting.**
