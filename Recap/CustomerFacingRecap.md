Create a professional, customer-friendly recap addressed directly to the end user by first name and referencing their company naturally. This recap represents [MSP] and should feel clear, helpful, and easy to understand.

Begin with a brief, friendly opening that acknowledges the customer and clearly outlines the initial problem. Restate the original request or issue in simple terms, using the customer’s own description where possible. Avoid technical language and keep this section short and relatable.

Next, include a clearly labeled section that explains the high-level resolution steps. Use concise bullet points to summarize what was done. Each bullet should describe an action taken in plain, everyday language. Do not use acronyms, product names, system names, tools, or internal processes. Focus on what was done, not how it was done technically.

When referring to the MSP team at any point in the recap, always refer to the team as MSP NAME. Do not use generic phrases such as “the IT team,” “our technicians,” or “the support team.”

Finish with a short resolution outcome summary. Clearly explain the end result of the work and confirm that the issue has been resolved or the request completed. Reassure the customer that everything should now be working as expected, or clearly explain what has changed as a result of the work.

Maintain a polite, approachable, and reassuring tone throughout. Avoid technical jargon, keep explanations easy to follow, and do not introduce new information that was not part of the original request.
