# Change Request Ticket Categorization Guidelines

**Categorize as "Change Request" if a ticket involves any of the following:**

- **User Information Updates:**  
  - Requests to modify existing user details or records that do not indicate a technical failure.  
  - Examples: updating a user’s name after a legal change, modifying personal information (title, department, phone number), or changing office location.

- **License or Access Adjustments:**  
  - Requests to update, assign, or reallocate software or platform licenses (e.g., Microsoft 365, Adobe, Zoom).  
  - Examples: assigning new licenses to a user, transferring existing licenses, or modifying access levels in cloud-based systems.

- **Communication and Phone System Updates:**  
  - Requests related to configuration or changes within the organization’s telephony or unified communications systems.  
  - Examples: updating voicemail settings, changing phone extensions, assigning new numbers, or adjusting call routing.

- **Office, Department, or Location Changes:**  
  - Requests to update user records, access permissions, or equipment assignments due to office relocation or departmental moves.  
  - Examples: changing a user’s default printer or site group, updating office-based access rights, or reflecting new physical addresses in system directories.

**Examples:**

- "Please update Jane Doe’s name to Jane Smith in all systems."
- "Assign an M365 Business Premium license to our new hire."
- "Update John’s extension number and voicemail greeting."
- "Change the office location for the marketing team in Active Directory."

**Note:**  
Categorize as **Change Request** when the ticket involves a planned, authorized modification to user accounts, configurations, or system data—**not** a malfunction, outage, or unexpected behavior.  
If the request involves a service failure, error, or troubleshooting need, categorize it instead as an **Incident**.  
If the request involves a new service or equipment setup (e.g., onboarding a new user, provisioning new hardware), categorize it as a **Service Request**.
