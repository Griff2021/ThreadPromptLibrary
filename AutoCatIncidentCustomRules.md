# Incident Ticket Categorization Guidelines

**Categorize as "Incident" if a ticket involves any of the following:**

- **Break-Fix Issues:**  
  - Tickets reporting something that was working but is now broken, malfunctioning, or producing unexpected behavior.  
  - Examples: applications crashing, devices not responding, systems freezing, printers not functioning.

- **General IT Support and Troubleshooting:**  
  - Requests for help diagnosing and resolving issues that interfere with normal IT operations.  
  - Examples: slow computer performance, email not syncing, unable to access shared drives, or system errors.

- **Password Resets and Account Assistance:**  
  - User access issues requiring account unlocks, password resets, MFA troubleshooting, or login assistance.  
  - Examples: forgotten password, locked-out accounts, expired credentials, or MFA token errors.

- **Software Installations and Configuration Support:**  
  - Requests related to installation, setup, or basic configuration of standard business software.  
  - Examples: installing Microsoft Office, configuring Outlook profiles, adding email accounts, or updating applications.

- **Hardware and Peripheral Support:**  
  - Issues with computers, monitors, docking stations, printers, scanners, or other peripherals that require basic troubleshooting or replacement coordination.  
  - Examples: keyboard not detected, monitor flickering, printer offline, or external drive not mounting.

**Examples:**

- "My computer keeps freezing and won’t open Outlook."
- "I forgot my password and can’t log into my account."
- "Request to install Adobe Acrobat and configure it for PDF editing."
- "Printer in the accounting department is offline and not printing."
- "The network drive isn’t accessible from my workstation, but others can connect."

**Note:**  
Categorize as **Incident** when the issue represents an unplanned interruption or degradation of service that impacts a user’s ability to perform normal work tasks.  
Requests that do not involve a failure or need for troubleshooting (e.g., new user setup, equipment purchase, access request) should be categorized as **Service Requests** instead.
