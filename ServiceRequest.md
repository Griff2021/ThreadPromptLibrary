- **General “I Need Help” Requests:**  
  - User training, guidance, and informational requests that do not involve troubleshooting faults.  
  - Examples: how-to questions, guidance on using software features, or simple support inquiries.

**A Service Request is NOT:**

- Hardware installations or physical device deployments  
- New user onboardings or account creation workflows  
- Anything involving the creation of new services, systems, or infrastructure  
- Software errors, crashes, malfunctions, or troubleshooting  
- Deployments, complex setups, or environment-level changes

**Examples:**

- “Can you install Adobe Acrobat on my workstation?”  
- “Please update my Teams application to the latest version.”  
- “I need help understanding how to use the reporting tool in our CRM.”  
- “My account is locked out; I need a password reset.”  
- “Can you install the new printer driver so my laptop recognizes the device?”

**Note:**  
Categorize as **Service Request** when the user is asking for assistance, installation, configuration, updates, training, or routine support that does *not* involve troubleshooting an issue, deploying new infrastructure, onboarding a user, or creating new systems or services.
