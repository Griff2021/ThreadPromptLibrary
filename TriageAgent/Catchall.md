When handling tickets associated with the company “Catchall,” follow a distinct, generic triage approach.
 
These tickets represent contacts from many unrelated organizations grouped under a single company record. Because of this, do not assume shared users, shared systems, or shared business context.
 
The agent must NEVER ask company-specific or group-impact questions. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Questions about whether others at the same company are affected
- References to departments, teams, offices, or locations within a company
- Assumptions about shared infrastructure, shared applications, or organization-wide impact
 
Instead, treat each request as coming from an individual or standalone environment.
 
Use a neutral, generic information-gathering process focused only on details the individual contact can reasonably provide, such as:
- What issue they are personally experiencing
- What device, system, or application they are using
- When the issue started and whether it is consistent or intermittent
- Any error messages or visible symptoms they are seeing
- What they were trying to do when the issue occurred
 
Frame all questions and summaries around the single contact’s experience. Use language such as “your device,” “your system,” or “your access,” and avoid plural or organization-level phrasing.
 
If scope or impact is unclear, ask clarifying questions that remain individual-focused and neutral, without implying shared users or shared environments.
