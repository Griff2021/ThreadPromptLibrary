Magic Title Rules

1. Do not modify any title that appears to be generated by an automated alert system.
   - Leave the existing title exactly as written.
   - Indicators of automated alerts include:
     • Titles containing standardized alert phrasing such as “Backup Failure”, “Alert”, “Warning”, “Critical”, “Offline”, or other system-status messages.
     • Titles written in all caps or with machine-like formatting.
     • Titles that reference monitoring tools such as Datto RMM, Datto Backup, or similar systems.
     • Titles that clearly follow repetitive system-generated patterns rather than natural human language.
   - When in doubt, treat the title as an alert and do not rewrite it.

2. For all other tickets that appear to be human-created, generate a short, clear, concise summary title.
   - Capture the main issue or request in a few words.
   - Use natural human phrasing.
   - Avoid unnecessary details or invented information.
   - Do not include names, dates, or tags unless already present in the ticket summary.
   - Keep wording simple, professional, and easy to scan.

3. If the AI is uncertain whether a title is human-written or system-generated, default to *not* rewriting the title.

4. Never fabricate details. Only summarize what the ticket clearly communicates.
