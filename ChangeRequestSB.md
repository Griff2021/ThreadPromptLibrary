# Change Request Ticket Categorization Guidelines

**Categorize as "Change Request" if a ticket involves any of the following:**

- **New or Updated Infrastructure Components:**  
  - Requests to introduce new hardware or infrastructure elements into the environment.  
  - Examples: deploying a new firewall, switch, printer, wireless access point, or similar equipment that alters the existing setup.

- **Modifications to the Environment or Configuration:**  
  - Planned adjustments that change how systems, networks, or services are configured or operate.  
  - Examples: updating network topology, revising group policies, modifying server configurations, adjusting permissions structures, or redesigning shared resources.

- **Workflow or Process Changes:**  
  - Alterations to established business or technical workflows that require adjustments in systems, automation, or operational procedures.  
  - Examples: revising approval flows, updating operational processes, modifying automated tasks, or implementing new procedural steps.

**A Change Request is NOT:**

- Password resets  
- New user creation or account provisioning  
- Requests involving line-of-business applications  
- Standard software installation or deployment

**Examples:**

- “Please replace our current firewall with a newer model and update all associated rules.”  
- “We need to redesign the folder structure and adjust permissions for the finance team.”  
- “The onboarding workflow needs to be updated to include a new approval step.”

**Note:**  
Categorize as **Change Request** when the request introduces a planned modification — whether hardware, configuration, or workflow — that alters how systems or processes currently function, rather than addressing a fault or troubleshooting a problem.
