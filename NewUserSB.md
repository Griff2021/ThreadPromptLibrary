# New User Ticket Categorization Guidelines

**Categorize as "New User" if a ticket involves any of the following:**

- **New Employee Onboarding:**  
  - Requests to create accounts and prepare access for an incoming employee.  
  - Examples: provisioning a new user identity, assigning licenses, setting up required access before their start date.

- **New Email or Domain Account Setup:**  
  - Creation of a personalized email address or user-level account associated with a company domain.  
  - Examples: creating firstname.lastname@domain.com, adding a user to Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace, or setting up authentication for cloud services.

- **New Shared Drive or Network Account:**  
  - Establishing access to shared folders, mapped drives, or network-based resources for a specific individual.  
  - Examples: granting access to departmental shares, creating new user entries in directory services, or issuing network credentials.

- **Converting a Generic Account to a Named User:**  
  - Requests to replace or supplement general-purpose mailboxes with accounts tied to an identifiable individual.  
  - Examples: transitioning from info@domain.com or sales@domain.com to a named employee account.

**Examples:**

- “Please onboard our new hire starting next Monday and set up their email and network access.”  
- “Create a new domain account and grant access to the marketing shared drive.”  
- “We need a personalized mailbox for our new team member instead of using the generic info@ address.”

**Note:**  
Categorize as **New User** when the request focuses on creating a new individual identity, mailbox, or access profile within the environment — including onboarding, domain accounts, or user-specific resource provisioning — rather than modifying existing accounts or resolving technical issues.
